Question: Why the id is the same when a and b are 100?

Answer:
Because numbers between -5 to 256 are the most commenly used numbers, the computer will store these numbers whenever the computer boots up. This helps with
performing and storage issues. Any number above or below that range is stored seprately and made with a seperate ID number. Any variable that is assigned within the
range of -5 to 256 all have a premade ID number assined to them  because the computer already stored those numbers.
